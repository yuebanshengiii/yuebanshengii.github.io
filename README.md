A free, open-source portfolio template for developers and job seekers. Edit one YAML file, push to GitHub, get a live portfolio — no account needed, no hosting fees, no framework knowledge required.

**Live demo:** [git-vitae.github.io](https://git-vitae.github.io)

---

## How it works

```
github.com/git-vitae/git-vitae.github.io
         ↓  Use this template
github.com/YOU/my-portfolio
         ↓  Edit portfolio.config.yaml
         ↓  git push
YOU.github.io/my-portfolio   ← live in ~2 minutes
```

---

## Quick start (3 steps)

### 1. Create your repo from this template

Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page → **"Create a new repository"**.

> **Naming tip:** Name it `yourusername.github.io` and your portfolio lives at the root (`yourusername.github.io`). Name it anything else (e.g. `portfolio`) and it lives at `yourusername.github.io/portfolio`.

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

In your new repo: **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**. Save.

### 3. Edit `portfolio.config.yaml` and push

This is the **only file you need to touch.** Every field has a comment. Edit it on GitHub directly (click the pencil icon), commit, and your site builds automatically.

```yaml
name: "Your Name"
title: "Software Engineer"
email: "you@example.com"
openToWork: true        # shows the "Open to Opportunities" banner

about: |
  Write 2-3 sentences about yourself here.
  The pipe symbol lets you write across multiple lines.

social:
  github: "https://github.com/yourusername"
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername"
```

Your live URL appears in **Settings → Pages** once the first deploy finishes (~2 min).

## Adding a profile photo

Set `avatarUrl` to any public image URL:

```yaml
avatarUrl: "https://github.com/yourusername.png"
```

GitHub profile pictures work perfectly — just swap in your username.

---

## Custom domain

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the repo root containing your domain (e.g. `jane.dev`)
2. Add a CNAME DNS record pointing to `yourusername.github.io`
3. In **Settings → Pages**, enter your custom domain

---

## Validate before you push (optional)

If you have Node.js installed locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/your-portfolio
cd your-portfolio
pnpm install
pnpm check-config   # catches typos and missing fields
pnpm dev            # preview at http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Getting updates

**Stay notified:** click **Watch → Custom → Releases only** on the [GitVitae repo](https://github.com/git-vitae/git-vitae.github.io) and GitHub will email you whenever a new version ships.

When you're ready to pull an update into your portfolio, run:

```bash
pnpm upgrade-template
```

That's it. The script adds GitVitae as an upstream remote (once), fetches the latest code, and merges it — without touching your `portfolio.config.yaml`. Follow it with `pnpm install && git push` to deploy the update.

Conflicts are extremely rare. They only occur if GitVitae renames a field in `portfolio.config.yaml` that you've already filled in. The script will tell you exactly what to do if that happens.

## FAQ

**Do I need to know React or JavaScript?** No. You only edit `portfolio.config.yaml`.

**Is this free?** Yes. GitHub Pages is free for public repos. GitVitae is MIT licensed.

**Can I make my repo private?** GitHub Pages requires a paid plan for private repos.
